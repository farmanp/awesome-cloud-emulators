## Introduction

This list provides a collection of cloud emulators that replicate the behavior of popular cloud platforms and services, such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). These emulators are invaluable for local development, testing, and debugging, enabling developers to iterate faster and avoid cloud costs during the development phase.

To provide a broader scope, we also include tools compatible with cloud services or that replicate cloud and related behaviors for various use cases.
